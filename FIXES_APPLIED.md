# MythoMaps - Issues Fixed & Deployment Ready

## Date: October 8, 2025

### Issues Identified and Resolved

#### 1. ✅ Attraction Images Not Loading
**Problem:** Attraction card images were not displaying on the India page and Home page.

**Root Cause:** 
- Image paths were using `/src/assets/images/Attractions/...` which doesn't work in production
- Vite requires static assets to be in the `public` folder for runtime access

**Solution:**
- Copied all attraction images to `frontend/public/assets/images/Attractions/`
- Updated all image paths in `attractions.js` to use `/assets/images/Attractions/...`
- Updated `Home.jsx` inline attractions to use correct public asset paths

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/assets/data/attractions.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`

#### 2. ✅ Itinerary Images Not Loading
**Problem:** Itinerary images on the India page were not displaying.

**Root Cause:** Same as attractions - incorrect path reference for production.

**Solution:**
- Copied all itinerary images to `frontend/public/assets/images/itineraries/`
- Updated all image paths in `itineraries.js` to use `/assets/images/itineraries/...`

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/assets/data/itineraries.js`

#### 3. ✅ Registration Form Error
**Problem:** Users could not register - the form was throwing errors.

**Root Cause:** 
- Frontend was sending an empty `photo` field
- Loading state was commented out causing UI issues
- No default avatar was being set

**Solution:**
- Added default avatar URL: `https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/149/149071.png`
- Enabled loading state (`setIsLoading(true)`)
- Updated backend to use default avatar if photo field is missing
- Added proper error handling with loading state reset

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx`
- `backend/controllers/authController.js`

## Testing Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Test registration with new user
- [ ] Verify all attraction images load on Home page
- [ ] Verify all attraction images load on India page
- [ ] Verify all itinerary images load on India page
- [ ] Test login functionality
- [ ] Test booking functionality
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Verify production URL loads correctly
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify images load from CDN/public folder
- [ ] Test user registration and login
- [ ] Monitor error logs

---

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Add Error Boundaries
Consider adding React Error Boundaries to catch and display errors gracefully.

### 2. Image Optimization
Consider optimizing images for web:
```bash
# Install image optimization tool
npm install -g sharp-cli

# Optimize images
sharp -i "frontend/public/assets/images/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}" -o optimized/ --format webp
```

### 3. Add Loading Skeletons
Add skeleton loaders for better UX while images are loading.

### 4. Environment Variables
Create `.env.example` files for both frontend and backend:

**Frontend `.env.example`:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**Backend `.env.example`:**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mythomaps
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 5. Add CORS Configuration
Ensure backend CORS is configured for your Vercel domain:

```javascript
// In backend/index.js
const corsOptions = {
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app'
  ],
  credentials: true
};
```
